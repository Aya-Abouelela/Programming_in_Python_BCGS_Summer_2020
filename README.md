# Programming in Python (BCGS; Summer 2020)
Materials for the course 'Programming in Physics and Astronomy with C++ or Python' (BCGS; Summer Term 2020)

## Goal of the course
The goal of the course is to teach physics/astronomy-students on the
master level how to efficiently and flexibly solve scientific
programming problems with the easy-to-learn, high-level programming
language Python. The course specifically addresses students with no
prior programming experience.
